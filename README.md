TicTacToe Game

This was an assignment from my Software Design and Analysis 2 class last semester. The user can play agains the computer, 
choose which object to be and which order to play.  However, it is not very smart. You can easily figure out that the computer
is simply filling in the next available space and applying no other strategy.

I asked my professor to teach me how to make the computer smarter, but we never got to it.
I have some ideas though, but am not sure how to implement it.
